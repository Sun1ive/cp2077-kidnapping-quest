Holocall Dialog: V and Mitch

(The holocall connects. The screen flickers as Mitch’s face comes into view, his brows furrowed with concern.)

Mitch:
"V? What’s going on? You don’t usually call unless something’s gone sideways."

V:
"Sideways doesn’t even begin to cover it. It’s Panam, Mitch. Maelstrom’s got her."

Mitch: (Eyes widen, voice rising)
"What?! What the hell happened? How’d they even—Panam wouldn’t just let herself get taken!"

V: (Gritting teeth, pacing)
"She didn’t have a choice. Maelstrom jumped her. Found a shard at their hideout—she’s alive, but they’ve hauled her off to their base at the docks. And trust me, it’s crawling with those chrome-head psychos."

Mitch: (Anger flaring)
"Those bastards! Panam risked her neck for us more times than I can count, and now this?! We’re not leaving her to those scavs, no way in hell."

V:
"I’m not asking, Mitch. I’m heading there now. Just need some backup, and I figured you’d want in."

Mitch: (Pauses, exhaling sharply)
"Damn straight I’m in. But we can’t just charge in guns blazing. Maelstrom’s got numbers, V. This’ll need to be smart, coordinated."

V: (Nods, determined)
"I’ve got a plan... sort of. We hit hard, hit fast, and we don’t leave until she’s out. But I’m not gonna lie, Mitch—this’ll get messy."

Mitch: (Smirking, loading a rifle out of frame)
"Messy’s fine. Panam’s family. And no one messes with family. You give me ten minutes—I’ll bring the truck, the gear, and anyone else I can rally."

V:
"Good. Meet me at the old overpass near the docks. And Mitch... thanks. Couldn’t do this without you."

Mitch: (Grinning, voice resolute)
"Save the thanks for when we’ve got Panam back. Stay sharp, V. We’ll bring her home."

(The holocall ends, the screen flickers off. V exhales, gripping his pistol tighter as the weight of the situation settles in. It’s go time.)
