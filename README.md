Basics:
Adds quest to rescue Panam Palmer now for both male V and fem V.

Fem V:
After quest activation, you gonna get a starting message.

Male V:
After quest activation AND if you have done the first dating quest AND don't have an active dating quest you gonna get a starting message.
If you have an active dating quest/waiting phase. Just complete it and wait for a message.

If you want the quest to be more challenging consider using Enemies of Night City mod.

You are going to end up on maelstrom's base. Be ready! Find and rescue her!

Installation:
Unzip the main zip into "Cyberpunk 2077" folder so that the .archive and .archive.xl files end up in the "Cyberpunk 2077\archive\pc\mod" folder
Make sure the required mods are installed too!

Uninstall:
Delete
1. `Kidnap.archive` and `Kidnap.xl` "Cyberpunk 2077\archive\pc\mod" folder.
2. `Kidnap` folder from "Cyberpunk 2077\r6\tweaks\"

In-Game Requirements:
1. Aldecaldos camp moved.
2. FOR MALE V ONLY I Really Want To Stay At Your House (dating quest) first done.


Warning/disclaimer:
THIS IS MY VERY FIRST MOD.
BEFORE USING THIS MOD CREATE A SAVE OF YOUR PROGRESS!
Just in case.

Knowing Limitations:
While you progress through the quest you can still receive messages from Panam
I didn't hook into this because there is a chance to break it without the possibility to "fix" this after all.
If you are facing a problem with completing objectives after combat it means you didn't finish all the enemies. Make sure you kill everyone even defeated mobs need to be killed. ( hopefully, I will fix it )

Languages:
English only at the moment.
